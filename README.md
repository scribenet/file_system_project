file_system_project
===================

An abstraction layer for creating structured fle system projects.

This is built to provide accessor methods to known, structured file system projects. Run the tests for details.

Structure is made known through a YAML file passed into the FileSystemProject class.

Also supplies accessors to metadata declared in a data.xml.

Maybe useful to someone else? Could be used to mock simple ActiveRecord models.
